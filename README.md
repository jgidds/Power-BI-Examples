Examples of Power BI work

- AutofilterExample.pbix : contains an example of autofiltering with DAX to sort data by most recent 3, 7, 10 and 30 day periods (with dummy sensor data). This was a workaround for a client with sensor data that had a time lag between uploads; viewing the last 7 days would provide them with only 5 days' data, etc.
